# SpicaTask

## Running

```bash
pnpm i # install packages with pnpm 

pnpm start # start local server
```

## Notes

- The login API does not allow CORS, I set up a proxy for development mode.
- The date params on `GET /api/v1/Absences` don't work as I expected, filtering is done on the frontend :(
